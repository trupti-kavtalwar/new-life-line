           <p> I would like to take this opportunity to introduce myself to you today. After completing my MBBS from Indira Gandhi Govt. Medical College Nagpur I pursued my Post Graduation in obstetrics and gynecology from the prestigious KEM Hospital and Seth GS Medical College Mumbai.
            </p>
          <p> It is during this training that I developed special interest in Fetal Medicine as a sub specialty and went on to pursue my fellowship in fetal medicine and advanced obstetrics and gynecology ultrasound. In this journey of furthering my clinical skills and knowledge I went to UK and was trained at the North Cumbria University Teaching Hospital. Here I not only gained a sound knowledge in the practice of evidence-based obstetrics, gynecology and fetal medicine but also had opportunity to complete my Royal College Membership Examination (MRCOG). To keep abreast with the recent advances in the field   of fetal medicine I recently successfully completed by Masters in fetal and maternal medicine conducted by the university of Barcelona.</p>
          <p>I have also been by certified by the fetal medicine foundation of UK as NT and doppler specialist.</p>
          <p>I am also recruited as an examiner for the royal college part 3 membership examinations (MRCOG PART-3)  </p>
